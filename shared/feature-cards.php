              </div>
              <p>
                We hold ourselves to high standards — this is the essential condition for providing our students with a high-quality education. We also hold our students to the same standards, encouraging each of them to take responsibility for their own learning.</p>

                  BOLDNESS
                </h3>
              </div>
              <p>Being bold means encouraging our students and teaching teams to push the boundaries of their creativity and step outside their comfort zones. It means inspiring them to try new approaches, to experiment, to sometimes make mistakes, to start over — and ultimately to succeed.

              <p>
                We are as kind as we are demanding. This means listening to others, respecting each individual’s personality, and accepting the right to make mistakes. Our students must also learn to receive constructive criticism positively and use it as a key to progress.</p>
